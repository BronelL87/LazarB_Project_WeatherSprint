#   Project - Weather Sprint

**Name**: Bronel Lazar

**Date**: 12/9/2024

**Description**: creating a Weather functional app based off the prototype of a classmate. Will contain a 5 day forecast based on the user's selected location.

**Day 1**: Not too much progress, focused more time in preparing myself for the evaluation. Started the layout on the html side, fetched api data for 5 day forecast.

**Day 2**: Will need to put in some work at home, project presentations took a little while. added another box in the html to prepare the local storage side, will work on the logic at home.
