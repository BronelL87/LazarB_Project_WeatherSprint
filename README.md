**Description**: creating a Weather functional app based off the prototype of a classmate. Will contain a 5 day forecast based on the user's selected location.

**Day 1**: Not too much progress, focused more time in preparing myself for the evaluation. Started the layout on the html side, fetched api data for 5 day forecast.
