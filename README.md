**Description**: creating a Weather functional app based off the prototype of a classmate. Will contain a 5 day forecast based on the user's selected location.

**Day 1**: Not too much progress, focused more time in preparing myself for the evaluation. Started the layout on the html side, fetched api data for 5 day forecast.

**Day 2**: Will need to put in some work at home, project presentations took a little while. added another box in the html to prepare the local storage side, will work on the logic at home.

**Day 3**: Progressed on logic, needs adjustments for overall weather forecast display, search functionality coming along, set up localStorage for the user's saved locations and recent searches

**Day 4**: Reverted my .then() methods back to async functions ( was only switched to .then() for troubleshooting purposes since it helped me visualize the flow better ) attempted to get saving the locations and recent searches to work but it seems that somewhere along the way I broke my search functionality, and the save button doesnt work at all strange since the search was just working not too long ago, will need to investigate further. Update: fixed search but i need to display state not country and saving locations and applying recents does not work at all

**Day 5**: Got the humidity, wind speed, precipitation to display, got the 5 day forecast with the high and low, couldnt get the time to update in the right format so I reverted it back to how it was, saved locations and recent searches are storing in the local storage but it seems theres something wrong with my retreival, my methods of changing the add to favorites button depending on if the location is in favorites or not doesnt seem to work. Will definitely need some work over the break

**Reviewer Notes**: I recommend using "cursor: pointer;" on your buttons just to help users see that they are buttons
